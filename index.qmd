This web-book is the companion to the course 'Open Science Practices: Implementing a Reproducible Workflow in R' (and other iterations) given by Daniela Palleschi at the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. The tools discussed in this book are specific to the R enviornment, but the concepts are universal and programming language agnostic.

## Aims of the book

- introduce students to basic concepts of reprodubility and replication in the scope of language research
- teach students how to implement a self-contained project-oriented analysis workflow
- help students develop good habits for project/data management
- teach students how to write up analyses for a paper or thesis using dynamic reports
- introduce students to concepts like version control and containerization

## What you will not learn in this book

- how to analyse data
- how to fit models
- how to plot data
- how to design an experiment
